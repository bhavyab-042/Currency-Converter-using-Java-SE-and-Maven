# Currency-Converter-using-Java-SE-and-Maven

## Introduction
* This currency converter is a  software code that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding value. In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money (e.g. 1000") and chooses the currency he/she wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. United States Dollar). After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other currencies, he/she would like to see the result in. The application software then calculates and displays the corresponding amount of money.
  
* The converter also stores the most recent market valuations of the world's currencies, which allows individuals to compare the value of one currency against those of others in the database. The values of the different currencies are determined based on the supply or demand of dealing prices between international banks.
